Share Along
===========

Share Along is an app designed to help facilitate communal ownership of things
like books, tools, media, and pretty much anything you *can* share. It is
designed for the `OSU Linux Users Group`_ but open for the world to use!

How it will work
----------------
When you start an instance of Share Along you will be able to add items to your
repository, request responsibility of an object, transfer ownership of an
object, and decomission an object.

Technical Stuffs
----------------
Share Along is designed to be an open API but primarily accessed through a
webapp interface. For more information checkout DESIGN.rst.

It will be implemented with the Django REST Framework as a Django Application.

How do install?
---------------
You may have noticed there is no code in this repo (or there's none that works)

Once Share Along becomes a bit more stable there will be a thorough
installation and usage guide. For now though check out #osu-lug on
irc.freenode.net or email the OSU Linux Users Group `mailing list`_ to get an
update/eta on the project. It is a product of blood, sweat, and pizza so try to
be patient.
